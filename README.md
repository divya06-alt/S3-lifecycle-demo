# S3-lifecycle-demo

This project demonstrates how to configure **Amazon S3 Lifecycle Rules** to automate storage management.  
Lifecycle rules help move objects to cheaper storage classes and delete them automatically after a defined time — saving cost and improving efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, you will see:

✔ Creation of an S3 bucket  
✔ Uploading an object  
✔ Setting up a lifecycle rule to:
- Transition objects to **Standard Infrequent Access (IA)** after **30 days**
- Expire (delete) objects after **365 days**
- Cleanup incomplete uploads

This is a real hands-on demonstration using the AWS Console.
